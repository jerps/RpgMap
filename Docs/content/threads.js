RpgMap is not threadsafe. That means that when multiple threads are active in a job that uses RpgMap, care should \
be taken that no two threads execute any RpgMap procedure within the same activation group at the same time. \
This can be done using synchronization constructs such as locks, sempahores or mutexes. One could also simply specify \
control-options keyword <code>thread(*serialize)</code> for an RPG module, and make sure that all access to RpgMap is \
done through that module. This ensures that only one thread accesses RpgMap at any moment in time. This solution has \
a coarse granularity. It hinders performance when many threads are waiting and there is a greater risk for deadlocks. \
However, for most practical purposes using <code>thread(*serialize)</code> would be good enough.\
